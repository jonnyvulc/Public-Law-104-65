PUBLIC LAW 104–65—DEC. 19, 1995
Public Law 104–65 104th Congress
An Act
To provide for the disclosure of lobbying activities to influence the Federal Government, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds that—
(1) responsible representative Government requires public
awareness of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence the public decisionmaking process in both the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government;
(2) existing lobbying disclosure statutes have been ineffec- tive because of unclear statutory language, weak administrative and enforcement provisions, and an absence of clear guidance as to who is required to register and what they are required to disclose; and
(3) the effective public disclosure of the identity and extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence Federal officials in the conduct of Government actions will increase public con- fidence in the integrity of Government.
